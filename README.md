# NLP-Based-Semantic-Analysis-on-Youtube-Comments-Dataset

## Introduction
In this notebook, I have a dataset of user comments for youtube videos related to animals or pets. I will attempt to identify cat or dog owners based on these comments, find out the topics important to them, and then identify video creators with the most viewers that are cat or dog owners.

## Data and Code
The code is from [here](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/1772353219017266/3842882422099798/105392983207357/latest.html).
